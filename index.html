    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Largest Cat in the Americas: Jaguars are the largest cats in the Americas and the third-largest cats in the world, after tigers and lions.
        </li>
        <li>Powerful Bite: Jaguars have one of the strongest bites of all the big cats. They can crush bones and even the shells of turtles with their powerful jaws.</li>
        <li>Unique Coat Patterns: Each jaguar has a unique pattern of rosettes and spots on its coat, similar to human fingerprints. These patterns help with camouflage in their natural habitats.</li>
        <li>Solitary Animals: Jaguars are solitary creatures and prefer to live alone, except during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why do we care?</h3>
    <p>Endangered Status: Jaguars are currently listed as near-threatened due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflicts with humans. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their habitats and reduce human-wildlife conflicts.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ecosystem Balance: Jaguars are apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the food chain. They help control the population of other species, which in turn maintains the balance of the ecosystem. Their absence could lead to overpopulation of certain species, which can disrupt the entire ecological web.</li>
        <li>Biodiversity: Jaguars are a key species in their habitat, and their presence supports a diverse range of flora and fauna. By conserving jaguars, we also protect the wide variety of other species that share their environment, contributing to overall biodiversity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>These <strong>magnificent creatures are crucial to their ecosystems</strong> and face ongoing threats that need attention to ensure their survival. Conserving jaguars involves addressing issues like habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, which can be challenging but is essential for maintaining the health of our natural world.</h4>
